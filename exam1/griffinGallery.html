                Peter is my step-father. Peter is married to Lois Griffin and is the father of Meg, Chris, and Stewie.
                He also has a dog named Brian, with whom he is best friends.

            <h2>
                Lois Griffin
            </h2>
            <p>
                Lois is my biologial mother and the mother of the Griffin family.
                She can be described as a stereotypical television mother and housewife, despite her admitting to
                being a recovering methamphetamine addict and a kleptomaniac.
