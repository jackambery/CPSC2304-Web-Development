                Lois Griffin
            </h2>
            <p>
                Lois is the mother of the Griffin family. 
                She and her husband, Peter, have three children: Meg, Chris, and Stewie, along with the family dog, Brian. 
                Lois is often portrayed as a stereotypical television mother and housewife, despite her admitting to being a recovering methamphetamine addict and a kleptomaniac.
