            The following gallery displays numerous images of my father's side of the family,

                Homer Simpson
            </h2>
            <p>
                Homer Simpson is my biological father. 
                He is clumsy, fat and very lazy. 
                Homer is also an alcoholic, and is not very intelligent. 
                He works as a Safety Inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant.

            <h2>
                Marge Simpson
            </h2>
            <p>
                Marge Simpson is my step-mother. 
                She is generally a very kind-hearted and loving woman. 
                In contrast to her husband and son, Marge hardly ever swears and, except on occasional incidents, puts greater effort into controlling her temper.
