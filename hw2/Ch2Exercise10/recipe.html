                Instructions
            </h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Line baking sheets with parchment paper and then set aside.</li>
                <li>Add butter, sugars, eggs, and vanilla extract to a large bowl. Using an electric mixer, beat over medium speed until nice and creamy, about 1 minute. </li>
                <li>In a medium sized bowl, sift together the baking soda, salt, and flour. Gradually add the dry ingredients to butter/sugar mixture, beating over low speed. Scrape the bowl then beat over medium speed for another 30 seconds until well-combined.</li>
                <li>Add chocolate chips and caramel chips to the dough and then stir to combine. Drop dough by rounded tablespoons onto prepared baking sheets, about 2-3 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes (mine are ready at 10 minutes), then remove from oven and allow cookies to cool slightly before transferring to a wire rack.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
